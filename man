.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shellby\fR [\fIfilename\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Shellby\fR is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.

.B Invocation
.in +2n
\fBShellby\fR can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by \fIisatty(3)\fR), an \fIinteractive\fR shell is opened.
When executing interactively, \fBshellby\fR displays the prompt \fI$ \fR when it is ready to read a command.

Alternatively, if command line arguments are supplied upon invocation, \fBshellby\fR treats the first argument as a file from which to read commands.
The supplied file should contain one command per line.
.B Shellby\fR runs each of the commands contained in the file in order before exiting.
