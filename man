.B shellby\fR \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shellby\fR [\fIfilename\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Shellby\fR is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.

.B Invocation
.in +2n
\fBShellby\fR can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by \fIisatty(3)\fR), an \fIinteractive\fR shell is opened.
When executing interactively, \fBshellby\fR displays the prompt \fI$ \fR when it is ready to read a command.

Alternatively, if command line arguments are supplied upon invocation, \fBshellby\fR treats the first argument as a file from which to read commands.
The supplied file should contain one command per line.
.B Shellby\fR runs each of the commands contained in the file in order before exiting.

.B Environment

.in +2n

Upon invocation, \fBshellby\fR receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was exeucted.

This \fBenvironment\fR is an array of \fIname-value\fR strings describing variables in the format \fINAME=VALUE\fR.

.B Command Execution
.in +2n
After receiving a command, \fBshellby\fR tokenizes it into words using \fB" "\fR as a delimiter.
The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command.
.B Shellby\fR then proceeds with the following actions:

.RS
1. If the first character of the command is neither a slash (\fI\\\fR) nor dot (\fI.\fR), the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.
If there exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
